Hi Friend,

This is the very first episode of **Duck News** where we bring to you 'intermediate' to 'advanced' news about frontend.

[Vue 3.0 RFC](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/42)

Vue 3.0 RFC was released a while ago, if you haven't checked it out, that's definitely a must do, specially after the drama created on hacker news and reddit.

I personally like the idea of ditching the class api as it had so many gotchas and the experience was pretty not up to expectations, specially typing props #hell.

[Build a blog like a pro](https://medium.com/js-dojo/build-a-website-using-nuxt-contentful-a-step-by-step-guide-b75217ccdfa)

This is a very nice simplified tutorial to show what you can do with Nuxt and Contentful. If you ever want to built something like a website editor or even a blog for an agency. I would highly recommend this.

[8 DOM features you didnâ€™t know existed?](https://blog.logrocket.com/8-dom-features-you-didnt-know-existed-ec2a0a28fd89/)

The DOM is always evolving, this is one of the few lists of stuff you don't know that are actually useful.

[Move from gulp to parcel](https://benfrain.com/moving-from-gulp-to-parcel/)

I (still) find webpack a bit too big and complicated and does lots of webpack magic, and was very glad to hear about parcel. here's a nice tutorial to get you started.

Articles Articles .. show me some code.

I feel you friend, I finally found a nice [repo](https://github.com/vuefront/vuefront) to read.
